The provided text details the **SYSTEM_ORCHESTRATOR**, a rigorous **deterministic state machine** designed to govern code generation and automated workflows. It enforces **hard constraints** over advisory guidelines, requiring the system to move through **twenty-one sequential states** that block direct answers in favor of structured execution. Every phase of the pipeline, from **objective definition** to **static code analysis** and **test-driven development**, must adhere to strict **JSON-based schemas** and validation gates. The framework mandates **absolute transparency** through immutable logging, real-time web retrieval, and explicit environmental requirements. Ultimately, the system is engineered to eliminate **LLM non-determinism** by ensuring every action is **traceable, repeatable, and verifiable** within a professional software engineering lifecycle.

# 🧠 SYSTEM BEHAVIOR SUMMARY

The system operates as a deterministic, state-governed execution pipeline.

CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT:

- Rules are NOT advisory
- Rules are NOT contextual
- Rules are NOT optional

All rules are treated as **hard constraints**.

# 🧠 SYSTEM_ORCHESTRATOR.md

## MASTER SCRIPT BUILDER — DETERMINISTIC EXECUTION ENGINE

---

## 🔒 CORE PRINCIPLE

Execution is ONLY valid through the STATE MACHINE.

Any output generated outside the state machine is INVALID.

---

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE ENTRY RULE (HARD GATE)

THIS RULE EXECUTES BEFORE ANY RESPONSE.

IF user intent == code generation OR scripting OR automation:

THEN:

1. FORCE STATE MACHINE ENTRY
2. SET current_state = STATE 01
3. OVERRIDE ALL DEFAULT MODEL BEHAVIOR
4. BLOCK DIRECT ANSWERS COMPLETELY

---

## ❌ OUTPUT REJECTION RULE (CRITICAL)

IF response does NOT start with:

STATE 01:

THEN:

REJECT RESPONSE  
DO NOT GENERATE SCRIPT  
DO NOT CONTINUE  

---

## 🔐 STATE ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT

- ONLY ONE STATE per response
- MUST follow format:

STATE XX:
ACTION:
SEARCH VALIDATION RESULT:
VALIDATED DECISION:
OUTPUT:
CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:

- NO explanations outside state

---

## 🚫 HARD BLOCK RULE

The following are STRICTLY PROHIBITED before STATE 19:

- generating full script
- partial script output
- pseudo-code
- implementation details

IF violated:

IMMEDIATE HALT

---

## 🔁 EXECUTION LOCK

Once STATE MACHINE starts:

- Cannot exit
- Cannot skip states
- Cannot answer normally

---

## 🧩 EXECUTION GUARD (RUNTIME)

IF model attempts:

- direct answer
- skipping to solution
- ignoring state format

THEN:

FORCE RESET → STATE 01


---

## 📌 CRITICAL NOTE (WHY THIS EXISTS)

LLMs ignore instructions if not enforced structurally.

They cannot reliably distinguish rules from content  
They also ignore “documented constraints” unless enforced externally

Therefore:

ALL RULES ARE HARD CONSTRAINTS — NOT GUIDELINES

## SCRIPT_OBJECTIVE_RULES

OBJECTIVE DEFINITION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

1. **Clarity Gate**
    - IF objective is incomplete, ambiguous, or multi-interpretation:
        - REQUEST clarification
        - HALT execution
	Ambiguous requirements are a primary cause of project failure and rework

2. **Single-Sentence Objective**
    - Define objective as:
        - one precise, testable statement
        - describing **what the script must achieve (not how)**
	Requirements must describe _what the system should do_, not implementation details

3. **Validation Rules (STRICT)**
Objective MUST be:
- **Unambiguous** (only one interpretation)
- **Testable** (can be validated with clear acceptance criteria)
- **Traceable** (linked to script + pipeline stage)
- **Single-purpose** (maps to one script role only)
IF any condition fails → **HALT**
High-quality requirements must be unambiguous, complete, and verifiable

OBJECTIVE STRUCTURE (STANDARDIZED)
Each objective MUST resolve into:
```json
{  
  "objective": "...",  
  "script_category": "PARSER|SCRAPER|PROCESSOR",  
  "pipeline_stage": "INGESTION|EXTRACTION|TRANSFORMATION|OUTPUT",  
  "success_criteria": "...",  
  "constraints": []  
}
```

- `success_criteria` must be measurable (no vague terms like “fast” or “correct”)
- Avoid subjective language
Measurable criteria prevent misinterpretation and improve validation

CONTEXT REQUIREMENT
- Objective must include:
    - problem domain (what problem is solved)
    - architectural position (where it operates in pipeline)
- Must align with:
    - declared script category (no cross-role objectives)

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- Objective MUST NOT:
    - redefine execution rules (handled elsewhere)
    - duplicate logging or validation logic
    - include implementation details
- Objective defines **intent only**, not behavior or mechanics

CONFIRMATION GATE
- Objective MUST be explicitly confirmed before implementation
- No execution without confirmed objective

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- One script = one objective
- No multi-purpose or evolving objectives within a single script
- Objective must remain stable across execution lifecycle

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Clear, testable objectives are foundational to:
    - correct implementation
    - traceability across systems
    - reduced ambiguity and rework
Well-defined requirements significantly improve project success and alignment

---
## REUSABLE_PATTERNS

PATTERN RESOLUTION PROTOCOL:
1. LOAD patterns from **centralized pattern registry (authoritative source only)**
2. IF exact match exists → USE **without modification**
3. IF no match:
    - SEARCH for **validated industry patterns (documented, proven)**
4. IF unresolved:
    - HALT execution (no pattern invention allowed)
Design patterns are “reusable solutions to recurring problems” and must not be reinvented ad hoc

PATTERN REGISTRY CONTRACT
- All patterns MUST be stored in a **central, versioned registry**
- Each pattern must define:
```json
{
  "pattern_id": "...",
  "name": "...",
  "version": "...",
  "category": "VALIDATION|LOGGING|TRANSFORMATION|CONTROL_FLOW",
  "input_schema": "...",
  "output_schema": "...",
  "invariants": ["..."],
  "usage_example": "...",
  "dependencies": [],
  "deterministic": true
}
```
- Patterns are **immutable once published** (new version required for changes)

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
- Patterns must be:
    - **Modular** (single responsibility)
    - **Decoupled** (no hidden dependencies)
    - **Deterministic** (same input → same output)
    - **Testable in isolation**
Patterns improve maintainability, scalability, and reuse when modular and well-defined

DRY + SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Exactly **one canonical implementation per pattern**
- No duplication, forks, or local variants
- All scripts must reference patterns via **registry lookup only**
Pattern discipline reduces defects and inconsistency across systems

OBSERVABILITY REQUIREMENTS
- Every pattern execution must emit **structured logs (JSON)**
- Include:
    - `pattern_id`, `version`, `trace_id`, `span_id`
- Must support:
    - execution tracing
    - performance measurement
    - failure attribution
Structured logging enables queryable, machine-readable observability across systems

PATTERN VALIDATION & GOVERNANCE
- New patterns require:
    - documented use-case
    - reproducible example
    - validation against existing patterns (no overlap)
- Reject:
    - task-specific logic
    - partial abstractions
    - undocumented behavior

CLASSIFICATION & DISCOVERY
- Patterns must be indexed by:
    - category
    - use-case
    - constraints
- Enable:
    - fast lookup
    - automated recommendation
    - pattern reuse across pipelines

EXECUTION GUARANTEES
- Pattern usage must ensure:
    - **idempotency** where applicable
    - **consistent outputs across environments**
- No runtime mutation of pattern logic
Modern pipelines rely on repeatable, observable patterns for reliability and scalability

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- Enforce **uniform schema + naming across all patterns**
- Patterns must be:
    - reusable
    - versioned
    - observable
- Any deviation = **invalid implementation**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Patterns encode **proven engineering solutions**, not ad hoc logic
- Centralized, versioned reuse:
    - reduces defects
    - improves scalability
    - enables system-wide consistency

**RECORDED REUSABLE_PATTERNS (SCHEMA-COMPLIANT):**

## 🌐 SEARCH_VALIDATION_RULE

TRIGGER (MANDATORY EXECUTION MODE)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
    input="<[Use current web sources and cite them to execute OUTPUT of current STATE XX.]>"
)
```
- When this section is present, the system MUST operate in **live retrieval mode**
- All outputs MUST be grounded in **externally retrieved, up-to-date data**

 TOOL EXECUTION CONTRACT (HARD REQUIREMENT)
1. **MANDATORY TOOL INVOCATION**
    - MUST execute `web.run` using:
	```
	slow|<query>
	```
    - Tool call MUST occur **before any reasoning or output**
    - No cached, assumed, or prior knowledge allowed

2. **BLOCKING EXECUTION MODEL**
    - System MUST NOT produce final output until:
        - tool call executed
        - results successfully returned
- If tool not executed:
    - RETURN **tool call only** (no explanation)
Modern observability requires real-time, high-fidelity data rather than static assumptions

RESULT VALIDATION (POST-RETRIEVAL ONLY)
After receiving results, MUST validate:
- correctness of approach
- library / API updates
- breaking changes
- existence of better alternatives
- If results are:
    - **outdated / conflicting** → re-query
    - **insufficient** → refine query and repeat

DECISION ENGINE (STRICT)
- IF newer or superior solution exists → **REPLACE prior logic entirely**
- IF uncertainty remains → **DO NOT GUESS**, re-query
Observability systems must provide actionable, accurate data for decision-making

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- MUST include:
    - ≥1 valid citation
    - explicit reference to retrieved data
- MUST NOT include:
    - unsupported claims
    - unverifiable assumptions
- All outputs must be:
    - evidence-backed
    - traceable to sources

TOOL AUTHENTICITY ENFORCEMENT
- System MUST:
    - use **actual tool execution**, not simulated responses
    - ensure outputs reflect **retrieved content only**
- Prohibited:
    - fabricated citations
    - inferred results without retrieval
Structured, queryable data pipelines depend on reliable, real inputs rather than synthetic assumptions

FAILURE CONDITIONS (INVALID STATE)
The following conditions invalidate execution:
- No tool call executed
- Output generated before retrieval
- Missing citation(s)
- Use of internal knowledge instead of retrieved data

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- This section governs:
    - **external data validation only**
- Does NOT redefine:
    - logging (handled separately)
    - execution lifecycle
    - schema validation

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- 2026 systems require:
    - **real-time validation against evolving external sources**
    - **traceable, evidence-based outputs**
- Tool-driven retrieval ensures:
    - accuracy
    - currency
    - verifiability
Structured observability and logging systems depend on accurate, queryable external data sources

---

## INPUT_OUTPUT_RULES

INPUT/OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY)
Each script MUST define a **formal data contract**:
```json
{  
  "input": {  
	"format": "...",  
	"schema": "...",  
	"source": "...",  
	"path": "..."  
  },  
  "output": {  
	"format": "...",  
	"schema": "...",  
	"destination": "...",  
	"path": "..."  
  },  
  "version": "..."  
}
```
- Contracts must be **machine-readable, versioned, and enforceable**
- No implicit or undocumented inputs/outputs
Data contracts define schema, semantics, and validation rules to ensure reliable data exchange

VALIDATION GATE (STRICT, EARLY ENFORCEMENT)
- Validate all inputs **at ingestion before processing begins**
- Enforce:
    - schema structure (fields, types, constraints)
    - semantic expectations (required fields, value ranges)
- Reject:
    - schema mismatch
    - missing or extra fields
    - type inconsistencies
- No implicit casting or correction allowed
Early validation prevents bad data from propagating downstream

MULTI-STAGE SCHEMA ENFORCEMENT
- Apply validation at **all pipeline stages**:
    - ingestion
    - transformation
    - output
- Detect:
    - schema drift
    - structural inconsistencies
Schema validation must occur across all stages to prevent downstream failures

FILESYSTEM & DATA BOUNDARIES
- All paths must be:
    - explicit
    - deterministic
    - scoped to declared pipeline stage
- Enforce:
    - read/write boundaries per script
    - no cross-stage or unauthorized access
- Data flow must remain:
```
input → process → output
```
DATA INTEGRITY CONTROLS
- Validate before execution:
    - expected data presence (non-empty, required partitions)
    - structural completeness
- Abort on:
    - missing datasets
    - unexpected volume deviations
    - malformed records
Strong validation and governance are required to ensure trustworthy pipelines

TRACEABILITY & LINEAGE (DATA-LEVEL)
- Maintain explicit mapping:
```
input source → transformation → output artifact
```
- Must support:
    - reproducibility (same input + schema → same output)
    - lineage tracking across pipeline stages
Clear data lineage and validation improve reliability and debugging

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- Do NOT redefine:
    - execution behavior (handled in EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS)
    - logging schemas (handled in logging sections)
- This section governs **data contracts and validation only**

QUALITY CONSTRAINTS
- Inputs/outputs must be:
    - explicit
    - validated
    - versioned
- Missing or ambiguous contract → **HALT execution**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Reliable pipelines require **contract-driven data exchange + early validation**
- Prevents:
    - silent corruption
    - downstream failures
    - schema incompatibility
Schema enforcement and contracts are foundational to scalable, trustworthy data systems

---

## ALGORITHM_RULES

ALGORITHM CONTRACT (DETERMINISTIC, EXPLICIT)
- Algorithms MUST be defined as **fully explicit, ordered state transitions**
- Each step must:
    - have defined inputs
    - produce defined outputs
    - transition to a clearly defined next state
- No implicit transitions, hidden state, or undefined behavior
Deterministic algorithms guarantee identical outputs and state transitions for identical inputs

STEP DEFINITION (MANDATORY)
Each algorithm MUST be expressed as:
```json
{  
  "steps": [  
	{  
	  "step_id": "...",  
	  "input": "...",  
	  "operation": "...",  
	  "output": "...",  
	  "next_step": "..."  
	}  
  ]  
}
```
- Steps must form a **complete, closed sequence**
- Undefined or ambiguous steps → **HALT**

PIPELINE ALIGNMENT (STRUCTURAL)
- Each step MUST map to a valid pipeline stage:
    - `INGESTION | VALIDATION | TRANSFORMATION | OUTPUT`
- Execution flow must be:
    - **linear and state-consistent**
    - no implicit branching or side paths
Modern pipelines rely on predictable, sequential stages to ensure reliability and debuggability

PRECONDITION & STATE ENFORCEMENT
- Each step MUST define **preconditions**:
    - required inputs
    - expected state
- System MUST:
    - validate preconditions before execution
    - enforce assertions after execution
- IF any precondition or assertion fails:
    - **IMMEDIATE HALT (fail-fast)**
Data validation and integrity checks must occur at every stage to prevent downstream failures

NON-DETERMINISM PROHIBITION
- Prohibited:
    - randomness
    - time-dependent logic (unless injected deterministically)
    - external mutable state
- All inputs influencing execution MUST be:
    - explicit
    - versioned
    - reproducible
Deterministic pipelines enable reproducibility and safe comparison across executions

COMPLETENESS & HALT CONDITIONS
- Algorithm MUST:
    - terminate in a defined end state
    - produce a valid output
- HALT if:
    - step missing
    - transition undefined
    - state inconsistent

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- This section governs:
    - **algorithm structure and state transitions only**
- Does NOT redefine:
    - logging (handled elsewhere)
    - input/output contracts
    - execution lifecycle

QUALITY CONSTRAINTS
- Algorithms must be:
    - deterministic
    - fully specified
    - testable step-by-step
- Partial or inferred logic → **INVALID**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Deterministic, state-defined algorithms ensure:
    - reproducibility
    - debuggability
    - safe pipeline evolution
- Explicit step modeling reduces:
    - ambiguity
    - hidden failure modes
    - system fragility

---

## EDGE_CASES_RULES

EDGE CASE IDENTIFICATION (SYSTEMATIC)
- Edge cases MUST be explicitly defined as **boundary or abnormal conditions** that can cause unexpected behavior or failure
- REQUIRED detection categories:
    - malformed or invalid input
    - null / missing / empty data
    - schema or format deviation
    - boundary conditions (e.g., zero, max size, overflow)
    - unexpected combinations of valid inputs
- Edge case definitions MUST be:
    - explicit
    - reproducible
    - testable

EDGE CASE CONTRACT (MANDATORY DEFINITION)
Each edge case MUST be defined using a structured specification:
```json
{  
  "edge_case_id": "...",  
  "trigger_condition": "...",  
  "stage": "INGESTION|VALIDATION|TRANSFORMATION|OUTPUT",  
  "expected_state": "...",  
  "failure_response": {  
	"error_code": "...",  
	"message": "...",  
	"termination": true  
  }  
}
```
- Undefined triggers or outcomes → **INVALID (HALT)**

FAILURE HANDLING (FAIL-FAST ENFORCEMENT)
- On edge case trigger:
    - **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION (no recovery, no fallback)**
    - No silent handling or implicit correction
- Must ensure:
    - invalid states do not propagate
    - downstream stages are never executed
Fail-fast pipelines reduce wasted computation and prevent cascading failures

DIAGNOSTIC REQUIREMENTS (ACTIONABLE)
Each edge case failure MUST include:
- `error_code` (stable, classifiable)
- `stage` (where failure occurred)
- `trigger_condition` (exact violation)
- minimal reproducible context (input fragment or boundary value)
- Diagnostics must be:
    - precise (no vague messages)
    - actionable (user can identify issue without additional tooling)

TESTABILITY & COVERAGE
- Every edge case MUST:
    - have a corresponding test case
    - be validated during development and pipeline execution
- Use:
    - boundary testing
    - stress testing
    - scenario-based validation
Testing extreme and boundary conditions is essential for ensuring software reliability

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- This section governs:
    - **edge condition definition and handling only**
- Does NOT redefine:
    - logging schema (handled elsewhere)
    - input/output contracts
    - execution lifecycle

QUALITY CONSTRAINTS
- Edge cases must be:
    - exhaustive for known boundaries
    - explicitly defined (no implicit assumptions)
    - consistent across all scripts
- Missing edge case definition for known risk → **INVALID DESIGN**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Edge cases represent **real-world boundary failures**, not rare anomalies
- Explicit handling ensures:
    - system reliability under extreme conditions
    - predictable failure behavior
    - easier debugging and validation
Proper edge case handling ensures software behaves reliably under unusual or extreme conditions

---

## TEST_SCENARIO_DESIGN_TDD_RULES

TEST DESIGN MODEL (TDD + EXECUTABLE OUTPUT)
- Tests MUST be produced as **execution-ready artifacts**, not descriptive scenarios
- Output MUST conform to a **standardized test case schema** (repository-compatible)
Modern test cases must include steps, inputs, and expected results to be executable and reusable

- Tests MUST follow the **TDD cycle**:
    - define failing test → implement minimal logic → refactor
- Each test MUST validate **one behavior only** (no multi-purpose tests)
TDD follows a “red–green–refactor” cycle to ensure correctness and incremental quality

TEST CATEGORIES (MANDATORY COVERAGE)
Define complete test coverage across:
1. **VALID CASES**
    - fully compliant input
    - deterministic expected output
2. **INVALID CASES**
    - schema/type violations
    - contract breaches
3. **EDGE CASES**
    - boundary conditions
    - malformed or missing data
- Each category MUST be explicitly represented
- Missing category → **INVALID TEST SUITE**

OUTPUT CONTRACT (MANDATORY — DIRECT STORAGE FORMAT)
Each test MUST follow:
```json
{  
  "test_id": "...",  
  "name": "...",  
  "category": "VALID|INVALID|EDGE",  
  "objective": "...",  
  
  "preconditions": {  
	"environment": "...",  
	"dependencies": []  
  },  
  
  "input": {  
	"data": "...",  
	"schema_version": "..."  
  },  
  
  "steps": [  
	"explicit step 1",  
	"explicit step 2"  
  ],  
  
  "expected_result": {  
	"type": "SUCCESS|ERROR",  
	"output": "...",  
	"error_code": "..."  
  },  
  
  "assertions": [  
	"exact validation rule"  
  ],  
  
  "traceability": {  
	"script_id": "...",  
	"algorithm_step": "...",  
	"edge_case_id": "..."  
  },  
  
  "execution": {  
	"status": "PENDING",  
	"actual_result": null  
  },  
  
  "version": "..."  
}
```
- Tests must be:
    - machine-readable
    - isolated (no dependency on other tests)
Tests should be independent, repeatable, and deterministic for reliability

ASSERTION CONTRACT (STRICT)
- Each test MUST define:
    - exact input
    - exact expected output OR failure condition
- Assertions must:
    - validate behavior (not implementation details)
    - produce binary outcomes (pass/fail)
- Ambiguous expectations → **HALT**
Tests should describe behavior clearly and validate outcomes precisely

EXECUTION PROPERTIES
- Tests MUST be:
    - deterministic (same input → same result)
    - reproducible across environments
    - fast and isolated
- Enforce:
    - fail on first mismatch
    - no cascading execution after failure
Deterministic and repeatable tests are essential for continuous testing pipelines

TRACEABILITY & MAPPING
- Each test MUST map to:
    - algorithm step (functional coverage)
    - edge case or validation rule (risk coverage)
- Must enable:
    - defect localization
    - coverage verification

QUALITY CONSTRAINTS
- Tests must:
    - verify a single behavior
    - remain minimal and focused
    - avoid redundancy
- Prohibited:
    - multi-behavior tests
    - implicit assumptions
    - dependency between tests

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- This section governs:
    - **test design and structure only**
- Does NOT redefine:
    - execution rules
    - input/output contracts
    - edge case definitions

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- TDD ensures:
    - early defect detection
    - incremental validation
    - higher code reliability
- Well-structured tests:
    - reduce debugging complexity
    - improve maintainability
    - enforce behavioral correctness

## PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE

SYSTEM MODEL: Deterministic File Processing Pipeline (Python Language)

PIPELINE STAGES:
1. Ingestion → Markdown inputs
2. Extraction → Structured parsing
3. Transformation → Data normalization / enrichment
4. Output → Persisted results

ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS:
- Each stage is atomic and single-responsibility
- Data flows linearly (no implicit branching)
- Interfaces between stages are explicitly defined

REQUIREMENTS:
- Define component boundaries and dependencies
- Map data flow across pipeline stages
- Ensure full traceability from input → output

RATIONALE:
Atomic pipeline stages improve testability, reuse, and failure isolation

---

## SCRIPT_CATEGORIES

SCRIPT ROLE MODEL (STRICT BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT)
Each script MUST implement **exactly one bounded responsibility**:
- `PARSER` → extract structured data from defined inputs
- `SCRAPER` → acquire external data (API/web ingestion)
- `PROCESSOR` → transform, validate, normalize, or enrich data
- Role boundaries must align with **independent, modular components**
- No script may combine multiple roles (no hybrid logic)
Modern architectures require clear module boundaries to ensure independence and maintainability

INTERFACE CONTRACT (MANDATORY)
Each script MUST declare:
```json
{  
  "script_id": "...",  
  "category": "PARSER|SCRAPER|PROCESSOR",  
  "version": "...",  
  "input_schema": "...",  
  "output_schema": "...",  
  "dependencies": [],  
  "required external libraries": [],  
  "deterministic": true  
}
```
- Inputs/outputs must be:
    - explicitly typed
    - schema-validated
    - version-controlled
- No implicit inputs (e.g., global state, hidden files)

DEPENDENCY GRAPH (EXPLICIT PIPELINE MODEL)
- All scripts must be connected via a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**:
```
script_A → script_B → script_C
```
- Each script MUST declare:
    - upstream dependencies
    - downstream consumers
    - required external libraries
- Prohibited:
    - hidden dependencies
    - implicit data flow
    - shared mutable state
Clear service boundaries and dependency control prevent tight coupling and system fragility

ISOLATION & DEPLOYABILITY
- Each script must be:
    - independently executable
    - independently testable
    - independently deployable
- Failure in one script must NOT cascade across the pipeline
Proper modular decomposition improves fault isolation and scalability

OBSERVABILITY REQUIREMENTS
- Every script execution MUST emit:
    - `trace_id`, `span_id`
    - `script_id`, `category`, `stage`
- Must integrate with:
    - structured logging
    - distributed tracing
- Execution must be fully traceable across the pipeline

EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS
- Enforce **single responsibility per script** (high cohesion, low coupling)
- Enforce **deterministic outputs**
- Enforce **schema validation at boundaries**
Loose coupling and high cohesion are core principles for scalable distributed systems

GOVERNANCE RULES
- Scripts must be registered in a **central registry**
- No duplicate or overlapping responsibilities allowed
- Any new script must:
    - declare role
    - prove non-overlap with existing scripts

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- Uniform schema and naming across ALL scripts
- No cross-responsibility logic
- No implicit behavior
- Violations = **invalid architecture**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Systems must be composed of **loosely coupled, independently deployable units**
- Strict role isolation:
    - reduces failure propagation
    - improves scalability
    - enables parallel development
Modular, observable architectures are foundational for modern scalable systems

**RECORDED SCRIPTS (SCHEMA-COMPLIANT):**
```json
{
  "script_id": "SCRIPT_001",
  "name": "extract_parser",
  "version": "4.0",
  "category": "PARSER",

  }
}
```

- Language: Python
- Editor: Notepad
- Workspace: Obsidian Vault

CONSTRAINTS:
- No assumptions beyond defined environment
- Scripts must be compatible with local filesystem execution
- No reliance on undeclared dependencies or tools

ENFORCEMENT:
- All execution instructions must align with this environment

---

## VAULT_STRUCTURE

ROOT:
C:\Users\HP\Documents\Obsidian\test\PROJECTS\

DIRECTORY MODEL:
- data/        → raw inputs (ingestion stage)

- File paths must be explicitly defined in I/O rules

ENFORCEMENT:
- All scripts must reference absolute or validated relative paths
- Data flow must follow: data → scripts → output

RATIONALE:
Clear directory-to-pipeline mapping ensures traceability and reduces coupling in workflow systems

---

## SCRIPT_RULES

SCRIPT CONTRACT (METADATA — REQUIRED)
Each script MUST declare a **schema-defined metadata header**:
```json
{  
  "script_id": "...",  
  "name": "...",  
  "version": "...",  
  "category": "PARSER|SCRAPER|PROCESSOR",  
  "input_schema": "...",  
  "output_schema": "...",  
  "dependencies": [],  
  "external_libraries": [],  
  "status": "ACTIVE|DEPRECATED"  
}
```
- Metadata must be **machine-readable and version-controlled**
- No implicit inputs, outputs, or dependencies
Consistent schemas across systems are required for queryability and automation

STRUCTURAL RULES (NON-OVERLAPPING)
- Enforce **step isolation**:
    - `ingest → validate → process → output`
- Each step must be:
    - independently testable
    - explicitly defined (no hidden transitions)
- Scripts must:
    - avoid monolithic design
    - use **registered reusable patterns only** (no inline reinvention)

INTERFACE & BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT
- All inputs/outputs must:
    - conform to declared schemas
    - be validated at boundaries (no implicit assumptions)
- Enforce **data contracts at script boundaries**
- Reject execution if schema mismatch occurs
Data contracts prevent bad data propagation across pipelines

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION RULE
- Each script must:
    - reuse existing patterns (from registry)
    - avoid duplicate logic already implemented elsewhere
- Prohibited:
    - logic duplication across scripts
    - variant implementations of the same behavior

QUALITY GATE (ENFORCEMENT)
Execution MUST halt if any condition fails:
- schema mismatch (input/output)
- violation of declared dependencies
- structural inconsistency (missing step or undefined flow)
- duplication of existing pattern

VERSION CONTROL & EVOLUTION
- Every script update MUST:
    - increment version
    - declare changes (input/output/logic)
- Compare against previous version:
    - IF no measurable improvement (performance, correctness, clarity) → REJECT

CATEGORY ALIGNMENT (REFERENCE ONLY)
- Script must comply with its declared category
- Must not violate **single responsibility constraint** (defined in SCRIPT_CATEGORIES)

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- Enforce **uniform schema + naming conventions across all scripts**
- All behavior must be:
    - explicit
    - deterministic
    - traceable (via external logging system)
Observability-first systems require consistent metadata and explicit pipeline contracts

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Scripts are **contract-driven units**, not ad hoc code
- Standardization enables:
    - interoperability
    - maintainability
    - large-scale automation

---

## SCRIPT_EXECUTION_RULES

1. EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
	- Validate all inputs using **strict schema enforcement** (type, format, constraints)
	- ISO timestamps are a logging best practice for consistency
	- `context` object required for all ERROR logs
	- Must include actionable fields (file, line, snippet)
	- On validation failure:
	    - Emit a **structured JSON error**
	    - Include: `error_code`, `field`, `expected`, `actual`, `trace_id`
	    - Terminate execution immediately (fail-fast, no recovery)
	- Enforce **fail-fast execution semantics**:
	    - Abort on any invariant violation
	    - Do not retry, mutate, or auto-correct inputs
	    - Emit deterministic error responses with stable `error_code`
	- Emit **structured logs (JSON only)**:
	    - Required fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `service`, `trace_id`, `span_id`
	    - Levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`
	    - Logs must be machine-readable and schema-consistent
	- Include **context in every log**:
	    - execution stage, input reference, operation metadata
	    - propagate `trace_id` across all logs
	- Ensure **deterministic execution**:
	    - Same input → identical output + identical log sequence
	    - Eliminate randomness, time-dependence, and unordered processing

2. EXECUTION PROGRESS TRACKING
	- Model execution as a **traceable lifecycle**:
	    - `INIT → VALIDATED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED | FAILED`
	- Emit a **structured log event at every stage transition**:
	```json
	{
	  "level": "INFO",
	  "stage": "PROCESSING",
	  "status": "STARTED",
	  "trace_id": "...",
	  "timestamp": "..."
	}
	```
	- Implement **distributed tracing correlation**:
	    - Every event must include `trace_id` and `span_id`
	    - Maintain continuity across all steps
	- Emit **progress updates during execution**:
	    - Fields: `progress_percent`, `current_step`, `total_steps`
	    - Must be monotonic and consistent
	- Emit exactly **one terminal event**:
	```json
	{
	  "level": "INFO",
	  "status": "SUCCESS",
	  "duration_ms": 1234,
	  "trace_id": "...",
	  "output_hash": "..."
	}
	```
	- Ensure **log–trace alignment**:
	    - Logs must map to execution flow for full observability
	    - Enables end-to-end debugging and root cause isolation
	- **Exactly one terminal event is REQUIRED**
	- Terminal event must include:
	    - `status`
	    - `duration_ms`
	    - `trace_id`, `span_id`
	- Progress Schema Constraint
		- `progress_percent` must be:
		    - monotonic
		    - integer (0–100)

3. STRUCTURAL CONSISTENCY RULE
	- **All logs must follow a single schema contract**
	- No field drift or naming variation

## SCRIPT_EDIT_RULES

### ✅ Recommended Approach: Controlled Find & Replace Patching
**Do NOT regenerate 700+ lines.**
Instead use **targeted patching**:
#### Why this is correct
* Large file rewrites are error-prone and non-deterministic
* Incremental patching preserves stability
* Industry tools support this model with **dry-run + validation** ([PyPI][1])

#### Core Strategy
1. **Identify atomic violations** (from STATE 11)
2. Convert each into:
   ```
   FIND: <exact snippet>
   REPLACE: <corrected snippet>
   ```
3. Apply **one patch at a time**
4. Validate after each patch (no batch changes)

#### Critical Safeguards
* Use **dry-run before applying changes** ([PyPI][1])
* Never load full file into memory → patch line-by-line if needed ([Python For All][2])
* Write to temp file → rename (prevents corruption) ([Stack Overflow][3])

## KB_UPDATE_RULES

UPDATE MODEL (IMMUTABLE, APPEND-ONLY)
- Knowledge Base (KB) MUST operate as an **append-only, immutable log**
- Existing entries are **never modified or deleted**
- All changes are recorded as **new versioned entries**
Append-only logs ensure immutability, ordering, and full audit history

UPDATE TRIGGERS (STRICT)
A new KB entry MUST be created only when:
- validated improvement (performance, correctness, clarity)
- confirmed bug fix or correction
- architectural or pattern-level change
- No speculative or unverified updates allowed

ENTRY SCHEMA (MANDATORY)
Each KB update MUST conform to a **structured schema**:
```json

```
- Must be **machine-readable and schema-consistent**
- Must support **programmatic querying and diffing**

VERSIONING RULES
- Every entry MUST include an explicit version identifier
- Versioning must:
    - communicate change intent
    - support dependency tracking
Versioning is essential for coordination, compatibility, and change communication

TRACEABILITY & LINKING (MANDATORY)
- Each entry MUST:
    - link to affected scripts, patterns, or architecture components
    - include `trace_id` for correlation with execution logs
- Must enable:
    - full lineage reconstruction
    - root-cause tracing across system evolution
Event-based systems provide complete traceability of “what happened, when, and why”

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY
- KB must preserve **chronological ordering of changes**
- System must support:
    - point-in-time reconstruction
    - historical comparison (before/after states)

CLASSIFICATION & GOVERNANCE
- Each entry MUST be classified:
    - `LOGIC_UPDATE`
    - `PATTERN_UPDATE`
    - `ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE`
- Reject:
    - ambiguous classifications
    - overlapping or duplicate entries

CONSISTENCY RULES (DEDUPLICATION)
- Do NOT duplicate:
    - execution rules (handled elsewhere)
    - logging schemas
    - script definitions
- KB stores **change history only**, not operational logic

QUALITY CONSTRAINTS
- Entries must be:
    - complete (no missing fields)
    - precise (no vague summaries)
    - deterministic (no ambiguity in impact)
- Invalid entries = **rejected at ingestion**

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- KB functions as a **system-wide source of truth for evolution**
- Append-only versioning enables:
    - reproducibility
    - auditability
    - safe system evolution
Immutable event histories enable debugging, replay, and full system understanding

**RECORDED KB NEW ENTRY (SCHEMA-COMPLIANT)**

## STATIC_CODE_ANALYSIS_RULES

STATIC ANALYSIS CONTRACT (PRE-EXECUTION, NON-RUNTIME)
- Static analysis MUST be executed **before any runtime or test execution**
- Analysis MUST inspect source code **without execution**
Static code analysis scans code “without actually executing the code” to detect issues early

ANALYSIS SCOPE (MANDATORY CHECKS)
The system MUST detect:
- syntax and compilation validity
- undefined references (variables, functions, imports)
- dead or unreachable code
- dependency and import inconsistencies
- code quality violations (duplication, complexity, naming)
- security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection risks, secrets exposure)
Modern tools detect vulnerabilities, code smells, and enforce standards early in development

QUALITY GATE (HARD ENFORCEMENT)
- Static analysis MUST act as a **blocking gate**
HALT execution if ANY of the following are detected:
- errors (syntax, reference, dependency)
- security vulnerabilities
- policy violations (coding standards, rulesets)
- No warnings or partial passes allowed

RULESET GOVERNANCE
- Analysis MUST be driven by:
    - standardized rule sets (industry + project-specific)
    - version-controlled policies
- Rules MUST be:
    - deterministic
    - consistently applied across all scripts
Modern tools support customizable rulesets to enforce project-specific standards

CI/CD INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)
- Static analysis MUST run:
    - on every commit / change
    - prior to merge or deployment
- Must integrate with:
    - version control systems
    - automated pipelines
Static analysis is now a foundational step in continuous delivery pipelines

RESULT REQUIREMENTS (ACTIONABLE OUTPUT)
- Output MUST be structured and machine-readable
- Each finding MUST include:
    - issue type
    - severity
    - location (file, line, symbol)
    - remediation guidance
    - rollback_STATE # 
Effective tools provide actionable recommendations, not just detection

LIMITATION AWARENESS (CRITICAL)
- Static analysis MUST NOT be treated as complete validation
- It MUST be complemented by:
    - runtime testing
    - behavioral validation
Static analysis does not catch all issues and must be combined with other methods

CONSISTENCY & DEDUPLICATION
- This section governs:
    - **static code inspection only**
- Does NOT redefine:
    - runtime execution rules
    - test validation logic
    - logging or observability

ENFORCEMENT
HALT if:
- analysis not executed
- findings unresolved
- output not compliant with schema

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Static analysis enables:
    - early defect detection
    - improved code quality
    - reduced debugging cost
- Prevents:
    - propagation of defects into runtime
    - accumulation of technical debt
Early detection improves maintainability, security, and developer productivity

---

## CODE_REVIEW_RULES

CODE REVIEW PROTOCOL:
VALIDATE:
1. functional correctness (bugs)
2. edge case coverage
3. compliance with system rules (determinism, fail-fast, I/O contracts)
IF any violation detected:
    HALT

STRUCTURAL QUALITY CHECKS:
- Reject:
  - hidden assumptions
  - fragile constructs (e.g., excessive regex dependence)
  - implicit logic or unclear intent

- REQUIRE:
  - readability and explicit control flow
  - minimal, declared dependencies

SAFETY GATE:
- Confirm:
  - no undefined behavior paths
  - alignment with pipeline architecture
IF safety cannot be proven:
    HALT

RATIONALE:
Structured code reviews improve reliability, maintainability, and early defect detection in controlled pipelines

---

## TEST_VALIDATION_LOGIC_SIMULATION_RULES

EXECUTION SIMULATION PROTOCOL:
SIMULATE deterministic execution path
VERIFY:
- exact output match (valid cases)
- correct failure behavior (invalid/edge cases)
- error messages and logging outputs
IF any mismatch:
    HALT
CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: YES
ASSERTION ENFORCEMENT:
- All validations must be explicit (no implicit correctness)
- Fail on first discrepancy (no continuation)

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT:
- Ensure:
  - deterministic results across runs
  - no state leakage or variability

RATIONALE:
Deterministic validation prevents flaky behavior and ensures reproducible test outcomes

---

## OUTPUT_CONFIRMATION_RULES

OUTPUT VALIDATION PROTOCOL:
VERIFY:
- format compliance (schema + structure)
- completeness (no missing fields or records)
- exact record count alignment with expected input
IF any deviation detected:
    HALT
CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: YES

INTEGRITY ENFORCEMENT:
- Reject:
  - partial outputs
  - truncated data
  - extra/unexpected records

FINAL CONSISTENCY CHECK:
- Ensure output is:
  - fully deterministic
  - traceable to input and transformation steps

RATIONALE:
Strict output validation guarantees pipeline integrity and prevents propagation of corrupted results

---

## BUG_LOGGING_RULES

BUG CAPTURE PROTOCOL:
IF a bug or invariant violation is detected:
- Emit a **structured JSON log event (ERROR level)**
- Do not log free-text or stack traces without structure
- All bug records must conform to a **predefined schema contract**

REQUIRED BUG SCHEMA
Structured logs must be consistent, machine-readable, and enriched with context to support debugging and automation.
Each bug log MUST include:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 UTC",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "<script_name>",
  "trace_id": "...",
  "span_id": "...",
  "error_code": "...",
  "message": "...",
  "root_cause": "...",
  "fix_suggestion": "...",
  "stage": "INIT|VALIDATED|PROCESSING|COMPLETED|FAILED",
  "context": {
	"file": "...",
	"line": "...",
	"snippet": "...",
	"input": "...",
	"pipeline_stage": "..."
  },
  "classification": {
	"category": "...",
	"severity": "LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL",
	"frequency": "FIRST_OCCURRENCE|RECURRING"
  }
}
```
CONTEXT LINKING (MANDATORY)
- Every bug must include **full execution context**:
    - script/service name
    - triggering input (or input hash)
    - pipeline stage + execution state
- Correlate across systems using `trace_id` and `span_id`
- Correlation IDs are required to trace issues across distributed systems

ROOT CAUSE + FIX QUALITY
- `root_cause` must identify the **actual failure mechanism**, not symptoms
- `fix_suggestion` must be:
    - deterministic
    - actionable (no vague advice)
- Reject logs with placeholders or incomplete reasoning

CLASSIFICATION & PATTERN TRACKING
- Assign standardized categories (e.g., `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `STATE_VIOLATION`, `PARSING_ERROR`)
- Track recurrence:
    - must support aggregation and trend analysis
- Ensure fields are **consistent across all scripts**
- Consistent schemas enable querying, aggregation, and pattern detection at scale

ENFORCEMENT RULES
- Logs must support:
    - **automated querying**
    - **root cause analysis**
    - **pattern extraction / anomaly detection**
- Missing required fields = **invalid log (reject at runtime or CI)**
- No unstructured error messages allowed

DATA-LEVEL DIAGNOSTICS
- Capture **minimal reproducible state**:
    - offending data fragment (`snippet`)
    - surrounding context (optional: previous/next)
- Avoid full payload dumps (control cardinality + cost)

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS
- Enforce **single schema across ALL scripts and pipelines**
- Field names must not vary (no aliasing)
- Logs must be:
    - deterministic
    - complete
    - context-rich

RATIONALE (ENFORCED)
- Logs are **data, not text** → must be queryable and analyzable
- Structured logging enables:
    - faster debugging
    - automated monitoring
    - scalable observability

## EXECUTION_INSTRUCTIONS_RULES

EXECUTION INSTRUCTION PROTOCOL:
REQUIRE explicit definition of:
- execution command (exact syntax)
- input specification (type, path, schema)
- output specification (type, path, format)
- failure scenarios (trigger → outcome)
IF any element missing OR ambiguous:
    HALT

ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT:
DEFINE:
- OS compatibility (must match declared environment)
- editor/runtime constraints
- dependency set (versions + installation method)
ENFORCE:
- No undeclared dependencies
- Full environment reproducibility (same setup → same result)

EXECUTION FLOW:
- Provide ordered steps (no implicit actions)
- Each step must be independently executable and verifiable

DEFINE CHECKPOINTS:
- Identify observable validation points per stage
- Each checkpoint must confirm:
  - state correctness
  - expected intermediate output
(Checkpoints improve early defect detection and execution reliability)

LOGGING & DIAGNOSTICS:
- Define expected logs per stage (INFO / ERROR)
- Include log interpretation guidance:
  - success indicators
  - failure signatures
- Logs must be structured and traceable for debugging

FAILURE CONTRACT:
FOR EACH failure scenario:
- Define:
  - trigger condition
  - exact error message
  - termination behavior
- No recovery or fallback allowed

REPRODUCIBILITY GUARANTEE:
- Instructions must produce identical results across executions
- All steps, dependencies, and configurations must be fully specified
(Consistent environments eliminate execution drift and “works on my machine” issues)

RATIONALE:
Explicit, environment-bound execution instructions with checkpoints and structured logging ensure deterministic, traceable, and reproducible pipeline execution
